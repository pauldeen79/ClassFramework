- Use deferred interpolation instead of [ ]
- For entities of type records, also include a copy constructor with this signature: (visibility same as default constructor visibility)
    public ToUpperCaseFunctionCall(FunctionCall original) : base(original)
    {
    }
- Add setting: InheritIBuilderInterfaceOnBuilders. If set to true, add the following interface: IBuilder<{{EntityType}}>
- Check the scenario used in CrossCutting, where we want to generate abstract entity and builder for a generic type (FunctionCallArgument)
