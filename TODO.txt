- Use deferred interpolation instead of [ ]
- Add setting: AddCopyConstructorsOnRecords. When set to trye, for entities of type records, also include a copy constructor with this signature: (visibility same as default constructor visibility)
    public ToUpperCaseFunctionCall(FunctionCall original) : base(original)
    {
    }
- Add setting for customizing types using an optional delegate, if you want to. e.g. System.Object => Expression and System.String => ITypedExpression<System.String>
  When it returns null, or the setting is null, then use the built-in method
- Add setting for customizing build statement using a delegate, if you want to. e.g. return new FunctionCallBuilder().WithName(@"ToUpperCase").AddArguments(Expression, CultureInfo).Build();
  Use an optional delegate named EntityInstanciation. When it returns null, or the settings is null, then use the built-in method
- Add setting: AddImplicitOperatorOnBuilders. If set to true, add an implicit operator, so you can pass builders where you need entities.
